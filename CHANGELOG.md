# Changelog

All notable changes to WHIRL are listed here. Versions follow `project(whirl VERSION ...)` in
`CMakeLists.txt`.

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Prefill attention: new GQA-grouped kernel (`attn_kg`) for f16 and q8v KV. One block holds the
  query heads of one KV head over 16 queries; K fragments are loaded straight into WMMA registers,
  f16 Vᵀ fragments with RDNA 4's transposing load (`global_load_tr_b128`), q8v V is dequantized once
  per block into a double-buffered LDS stage, and there is one barrier per 32-key tile. Outputs are
  bit-identical to the previous kernel (kernel-test invariants; last-token logits, MTP == plain and
  server outputs identical to 0.1.2). Kernel throughput at long context: f16 ~65 → ~93 TFLOPS, q8v
  ~61 → ~84 TFLOPS. `whirl bench` prefill, Swift-1.5 27B MXFP4-A (f16 KV, R9700): 32k +10%, 64k
  +17%, 96k +21%, 128k +24%; Ornith MXFP4 64k +11%, 128k +14%. Long prompts on the server (q8v KV for the dense
  models) gain the same way: Swift 96k +19%, 128k +21%. `WHIRL_ATTN_KG=0` restores the previous
  kernel. See [kernels.md](docs/guide/en/kernels.md#flash).

### Added

- `whirl bench`: `WHIRL_PROFILE=1` prints the per-op-class GPU time of each prefill size.

## 0.1.2 — unreleased

### Changed

- Server: the pinned-RAM tier of the prefix cache (`--kv-ram-mb`) is now sized from the machine
  instead of a fixed max(8 GiB, one full-length session + checkpoints) ≈ 9 GiB: **1/4 of physical
  RAM** (nearest GiB), at least that old minimum, at most 32 GiB (the minimum wins over the cap), and
  never more than half of the RAM available at startup (so the pinned arena does not push the machine
  into paging; logged as a warning when it limits the size; under 1 GiB the tier stays off). A 64 GB
  PC now gets 16 GiB. In real agent use (Hermes, 30–40k-token sessions with subagents) the old 9 GiB
  filled within an hour, after which restores came from the SSD. `--kv-ram-mb N` /
  `WHIRL_KV_RAM_MB=N` still override (used as given), `0` still turns the host tiers off. On an
  integrated GPU (shared system memory) the RAM tier is off unless a size is given. The startup log
  prints the chosen size and the reason, and the pinning time.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-10-03

### Added

- Server: read-only compatibility endpoints for clients that auto-detect the server type and context
  length (agent frameworks, chat front ends, IDE plugins):
  - `GET /props` and `GET /v1/props` — llama.cpp-server-style subset: `default_generation_settings`
    (`n_ctx` = context per slot, `model`), `total_slots`, `model_path` (file name only), `model_alias`,
    `modalities`, `build_info`.
  - `GET /version` — `{"version":"0.1.1","name":"whirl"}`.

- Chat requests: the OpenRouter / OpenAI Responses-style `"reasoning": {"effort": "...", "enabled": bool}`
  object, and effort aliases: `max` / `ultra` / `xhigh` / `high` → xhigh, `medium` → medium,
  `low` / `minimal` → low, `none` → thinking off (values are case-insensitive).

- Server: decode floor, `--decode-min-tps N` (env `WHIRL_DECODE_MIN_TPS`, default 20, `0` = off).
  While other requests prefill long prompts, every streaming request keeps at least N tok/s: prefill
  forwards are limited to a row budget (whole chunks; the oldest request always progresses) and decode
  cycles are interleaved, adapted every cycle from the measured decode-cycle time, tokens per cycle and
  prefill rate. Swift-1.5 27B MXFP4 on the R9700, one stream at 25.7k context + three ~17k-token prompts:
  the stream goes from 3.3 to 23.0 tok/s (longest pause 1.22 → 0.47 s), prefill throughput meanwhile
  2791 → 1862 tok/s, mean TTFT of the three 17.8 → 18.6 s. With no slot decoding, prefill is unchanged;
  outputs are bit-identical for any N; short-prompt C = 1 / C = 4 throughput unchanged.

### Changed

- Chat requests: an unknown reasoning effort no longer fails the request with 400; the server logs a
  warning and uses the default effort. Prompts for the values accepted before are unchanged.
- Server: probes of LM Studio / Ollama native paths (`/api/v1/models`, `/api/tags`, `/api/show`,
  `/api/version`, `/api/v0/models`) still answer 404 but are logged once per path at `I` level
  instead of a `W` line per request.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-03

- First public release: native Windows C++/HIP inference engine for qwen35 / qwen35moe GGUF models on
  the Radeon AI PRO R9700 (gfx1201) — `whirl.exe` (CLI) and `whirl-server.exe` (OpenAI-compatible
  server with continuous batching, prefix cache, RAM / SSD KV tiers, MTP and n-gram speculative
  decoding, image input).
